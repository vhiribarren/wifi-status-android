# Wifi Status for Android

This app displays in the notification bar the current Wi-Fi access point.

With modern Android (Lollipop and above version) it is not very useful since the information is
already displayed in the bar. However it can be useful for older Android version, or if you
want a quicker access to the current access point name.

From a developer point of view, the app also demonstrates:

- usage of wifi status receiver in the manifest file
- how to disable a receiver declared in a manifest file
- how to persist a notification
- how to not display the icon of the notification in the status bar
- no service needed to monitor and react to wifi connections change
